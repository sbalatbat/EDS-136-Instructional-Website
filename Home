Hello! I am Sarah Claire S. Balatbat. I was a UCSD PAL Tutor at San Diego High School during Spring Quarter 2023 (April-June). I mainly tutored Ms. Jones' AP Calculus AB classes but I also helped with her Integrated Math I classes. I am a college student in UCSD's Sixth College majoring in Computer Science and my favorite subject is calculus.
Some hobbies of mine are playing guitar, drawing digitally and playing video games like Smash Ultimate, Overwatch 2, and Minecraft. I also really love cats, here is a picture of my sister's cat! [insert photo of Lev]
